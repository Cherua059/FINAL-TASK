# PROJECT REPORT
## EXPERIENCE
AT THE START OF THE INTERNSHIP,I HAD VERY BASIC AND ELEMENTAL KNWOLEDGE OF PYTHON AND HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED ITS APPLICATION IN THE TRUE SENSE.IN THE COURSE OF THE INTERNSHIP, I WAS ABLE TO GRASP THE FINER DETAILS OF PROGRAMMING AND ALSO LEARNT HOW TO APPROACH EVERY QUESTION OR PROBLEM SYSTEMATICALLY TO OBTAIN THE BEST SOLUTION.
## TOPICS COVERED
1. PYTHON BASICS
2. DATA HANDLING,CLEANING AND PROCESSING
3. TYPES OF DATA
4. SORTING AND SELECTION OF VARIOUS FEATURES
5. EFFICIENT HANDLING OF DATA
6. VARIOUS ALGORITHMS OF MACHINE LEARNING
7. CONCEPT OF FITTING AND ACCURACY
8. PLOTTING DATA, INTERPRETING PLOTS AND VARIOUS TYPES OF PLOTS AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE.
## ALGORITHMS USED 
### 1. REGRESSION :- 
Regression is a statistical method used in finance, investing, and other disciplines that attempts to determine the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent variable and a series of other variables. The two basic types of regression are simple linear regression and multiple linear regression, although there are non-linear regression methods for more complicated data and analysis. Simple linear regression uses one independent variable to explain or predict the outcome of the dependent variable Y, while multiple linear regression uses two or more independent variables to predict the outcome.
### 2. LINEAR REGRESSION :-
Linear regression is an approach for predicting a response using a single feature. It is assumed that the two variables are linearly related. Hence, we try to find a linear function that predicts the response value(y) as accurately as possible as a function of the feature or independent variable(x).
### 3. LOGISTIC REGRESSION :-
Logistic regression is basically a supervised classification algorithm. In a classification problem, the target variable(or output), y, can take only discrete values for given set of features(or inputs), X.
### 4. DECISION TREE REGRESSION :-
Decision tree regression observes features of an object and trains a model in the structure of a tree to predict data in the future to produce meaningful continuous output. Continuous output means that the output/result is not discrete, i.e., it is not represented just by a discrete, known set of numbers or values.
### 5. RANDOM FOREST REGRESSION :-
A Random Forest is an ensemble technique capable of performing both regression and classification tasks with the use of multiple decision trees and a technique called Bootstrap and Aggregation, commonly known as bagging. The basic idea behind this is to combine multiple decision trees in determining the final output rather than relying on individual decision trees.
Random Forest has multiple decision trees as base learning models. We randomly perform row sampling and feature sampling from the dataset forming sample datasets for every model. This part is called Bootstrap.
## FINAL TASK
We were assigned a task of creating a machine learning model that would be able to predict the final grade of the student based on several input parameters.
## APPROACH TO THE FINAL TASK
1. Made sure that the data is in an accessible format, if it was unaccesible, it was converted it to the required format.
2. Specified all noticeable anomalies and missing data points that were required to achieve the required data.
3. Created machine learning model
4. Separated data for training and testing
5. Trained the data machine learning model.
6. Values were predicted using testing data
7. The performance metrics of both the test data and the predicted data from the model were compared
8. Modifications were made when the data didnâ€™t satisfy our expectations.
## OBSERVATION
1. The linear regression model had a reasonable accuracy score, but the difference between training and testing scores were quite high, indicating poor precision/classification ability.
2. After performing backward elimination, only 6 of the 33 features were considered and hence,the accuracy was further improved along with precision (age,grades,reason,etc.)
3. logistic regression model had very low accuracy where as decision tree and random forest regression models had fairly high accuracy.
4. the type of data is important while considering the type of machine earning model.
5. changing the amount of data used for training of the model is has a significant efect on the accuracy.
## FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION
1. this particular type of dataset an be used to create several analysisng mechanisms to provide an insight on the exact parameters to a student to dvelop and improve their grades. 
2. this methods can be used to make a disease prediction model which may detect the diseases based on the symptoms of the patient.
3. can be used in the field of agriculture to predict hotspots for pests and other insects and prevent crop destruction.
